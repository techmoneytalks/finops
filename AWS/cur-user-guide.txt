AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
How Cost and Usage Reports work



What are AWS Cost and Usage 
Reports?

The AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of cost and usage 
data available. You can use Cost and Usage Reports to publish your AWS billing reports to an Amazon 
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you own. You can receive reports that break down your 
costs by the hour, day, or month, by product or product resource, or by tags that you define yourself. 
AWS updates the report in your bucket once a day in comma-separated value (CSV) format. You can view 
the reports using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Apache OpenOffice Calc, or access 
them from an application using the Amazon S3 API.

AWS Cost and Usage Reports tracks your AWS usage and provides estimated charges associated with 
your account. Each report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS products, usage type, 
and operation that you use in your AWS account. You can customize the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to 
aggregate the information either by the hour, day, or month.

AWS Cost and Usage Reports can do the following:

•

Deliver report files to your Amazon S3 bucket


•

Update the report up to three times a day


•

Create, retrieve, and delete your reports using the AWS CUR API Reference




How Cost and Usage Reports work

After you create a Cost and Usage Report, AWS sends your report to the Amazon S3 bucket that you 
specify. AWS updates your report at least once a day until your charges are finalized.

Your report files consist of a .csv file or a collection of .csv files and a manifest file. You can choose 
to configure your report data for integration with Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon 
QuickSight.

Report timeline

After you create your report, it can take up to 24 hours for AWS to deliver the first report to your 
Amazon S3 bucket.

After delivery starts, AWS updates the report files at least once a day. Each report update in a given 
month is cumulative, so each version of the report includes all of the billing data for the month to date. 
The report updates that you receive throughout the month are estimates. The charges are subject to 
change as you continue to use your AWS services.

Note

Different AWS services provide your usage-based billing information at different times, so you 
might notice updates to a certain hour or day come in at different times.

AWS builds on previous reports until the end of the billing period. AWS finalizes your report’s usage 
charges after issuing an invoice at the end of the month. After the end of the report billing period, AWS 
generates a new report for the next month with none of the information from the previous report.

After your report is finalized, AWS might update the report if AWS applies refunds, credits, or AWS 
Support fees to your usage for the month. Because Developer, Business, and Enterprise Support are 

1


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Report files



calculated based on final usage charges, those are reflected on the sixth or seventh of the month for 
the prior month’s Cost and Usage Report. AWS applies credits or refunds based on the terms of your 
agreement or contract with AWS.

Report files

Your report is a .csv file or a collection of .csv files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The number of files 
that your report generates depends on your selection for report versioning and the size of your report.

When you create a report, you can choose to create new report versions or overwrite the existing report 
version with every update. If you choose to create new report versions, then your report generates more 
files with every update.

The size of an individual report can grow to more than a gigabyte and might exceed the capacity of 
desktop spreadsheet applications to display every line. If a report is larger than most applications can 
handle (around 1 million rows), then AWS splits the report into multiple files that are stored in the same 
folder in the Amazon S3 bucket.

AWS also generates refunds into separate files. AWS issues refunds after the closing of a monthly bill.

For more information on report files, file-naming conventions, and versioning, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

Report columns

Each report includes several columns with details about your AWS costs and usage. The columns that 
AWS includes in your report depend on your usage during the month.

Every report includes columns with the identity/, bill/, and lineItem/ prefixes. All other columns are 
included only if your monthly AWS usage generates data to populate those columns. For example, your 
report includes savingsPlan/ columns only if you used Savings Plans during that month.

To learn more about the columns in your report, see the No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

Using your report

You can download your report from the Amazon S3 console, query the report using Amazon Athena, or 
upload the report into Amazon Redshift or Amazon QuickSight.

Setting up an Amazon S3 bucket 
for Cost and Usage Reports



Creating Cost and Usage Reports

You can use the Cost & Usage Reports page in the Billing and Cost Management console to create Cost 
and Usage Reports. In the following section, you'll find information on how to get started with Cost and 
Usage Reports.

Setting up an Amazon S3 bucket for Cost and 
Usage Reports

To receive billing reports, you must have an Amazon S3 bucket in your AWS account to receive and store 
your reports. When creating a Cost and Usage Report in the billing console, you can select an existing 
Amazon S3 bucket that you own or create a new bucket. In either case, you’ll be asked to review and 
confirm the application of the following default bucket policy. Editing this policy in the Amazon S3 
console or changing the bucket owner after you’ve created a Cost and Usage Report will prevent AWS 
from being able to deliver your reports. Storing the billing reports data in your Amazon S3 bucket is 
billed at standard Amazon S3 rates. For more information, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

The following policy is applied to every bucket when creating a Cost and Usage Report:

{ 
"Statement": [ 
{ 
"Effect": "Allow", 
"Principal": { 
"Service": "billingreports.amazonaws.com" 
}, 
"Action": [ 
"s3:GetBucketAcl", 
"s3:GetBucketPolicy" 
], 
"Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", 
"Condition": { 
"StringEquals": { 
"aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cur:us-east-1:${AccountId}:definition/*", 
"aws:SourceAccount": "${AccountId}" 
} 
} 
}, 
{ 
"Sid": "Stmt1335892526596", 
"Effect": "Allow", 
"Principal": { 
"Service": "billingreports.amazonaws.com" 
}, 
"Action": "s3:PutObject", 
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*", 
"Condition": { 
"StringEquals": { 
"aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cur:us-east-1:${AccountId}:definition/*", 

3


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Creating Cost and Usage Reports



 "aws:SourceAccount": "${AccountId}" 
} 
} 
} 
]
}

This default policy helps ensure that the Cost and Usage Report data can be read by the bucket 
owner and confirms that the bucket is owned by the account that created the Cost and Usage Report. 
Specifically:

•

Every time a Cost and Usage Report is delivered, AWS first confirms whether the bucket is still 
owned by the account which setup the report. If the bucket ownership has changed, the report 
will not be delivered. This helps to ensure the security of the account’s billing data. This bucket 
policy allows AWS ("Effect": "Allow") to check which account owns the bucket ("Action": 
["s3:GetBucketAcl", "s3:GetBucketPolicy").


•

To deliver reports to your Amazon S3 bucket, AWS needs write permissions for that bucket. 
To do this, the bucket policy grants ("Effect": "Allow") the AWS Cost and Usage Reports 
service ("Service": "billingreports.amazonaws.com") permission to deliver ("Action": 
"s3:PutObject") reports to the bucket you own ("Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-
BUCKET/*").

This bucket policy does not give AWS permissions to read or delete any objects in your bucket, 
including the Cost and Usage Reports after they’ve been delivered.


•

For an Amazon S3 bucket that has ACL enabled, AWS further applies a BucketOwnerFullControlACL to the reports when delivering them. By default, Amazon S3 objects, such as these reports, can 
only be read by the user or service principal who wrote them. To provide you or the bucket owner 
with permission to read the reports, AWS must apply the BucketOwnerFullControl ACL. The ACL 
grants the bucket owner Permission.FullControl for these reports. However, it’s recommended 
to disable ACL and use an Amazon S3 bucket policy to control access. Note that Amazon S3 has 
changed the default settings and, for newly created buckets, ACLs are disabled by default. For more 
information, see No alternate text specified
.




If you see an Invalid bucket error in your billing console for Cost and Usage Report, you should verify 
that this policy and bucket ownership haven’t changed after report setup.

Creating Cost and Usage Reports

You can use the Cost & Usage Reports page of the Billing and Cost Management console to create Cost 
and Usage Reports. You can create up to 10 reports for an individual AWS account.

Note

It can take up to 24 hours for AWS to start delivering reports to your Amazon S3 bucket. After 
delivery starts, AWS updates the AWS Cost and Usage Reports files at least once a day.

To create Cost and Usage Reports

1.

Sign in to the Billing and Cost Management console at No alternate text specified



2.

In the navigation pane, choose Cost & Usage Reports.


3.

Choose Create report.


4.

For Report name, enter a name for your report.


5.

For Report additional content, select Include resource IDs to include the IDs of each individual 
resource in the report.




4


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Creating Cost and Usage Reports



Note

Including resource IDs creates individual line items for each of your resources. This might 
increase the size of your Cost and Usage Reports files significantly, based on your AWS 
usage.


6.

Select Split cost allocation data to include detailed cost and usage for shared resources (Amazon 
ECS only).

Note

Including split cost allocation data creates individual line items for each of your resources 
(that is, ECS tasks). This might increase the size of your Cost and Usage Reports files 
significantly, based on your AWS usage.


7.

For Data refresh settings, select whether you want the AWS Cost and Usage Reports to refresh if 
AWS applies refunds, credits, or support fees to your account after finalizing your bill. When a report 
refreshes, a new report is uploaded to Amazon S3.


8.

Choose Next.


9.

For S3 bucket, choose Configure.


10.

In the Configure S3 bucket dialog box, do one of the following:

•

Select an existing bucket.


•

Select Create a bucket, enter a bucket name, and then choose the Region where you want to 
create a new bucket.





11.

Review the bucket policy, select The following default policy will be applied to your bucket, and 
then choose Save.


12.

For Report path prefix, enter the report path prefix that you want prepended to the name of your 
report.


13.

For Time granularity, choose one of the following:

•

Hourly if you want the line items in the report to be aggregated by the hour.


•

Daily if you want the line items in the report to be aggregated by the day.


•

Monthly if you want the line items in the report to be aggregated by month.





14.

For Report versioning, choose whether you want each version of the report to overwrite the 
previous version of the report or to be delivered in addition to the previous versions.

Overwriting reports can save on Amazon S3 storage costs. Delivering new report versions can 
improve auditability of billing data over time.


15.

For Enable report data integration for, select whether you want to enable your Cost and Usage 
Reports to integrate with Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon QuickSight. The report is 
compressed in the following formats:

•

Athena: parquet format


•

Amazon Redshift or Amazon QuickSight: .gz compression





16.

Choose Next.


17.

After you have reviewed the settings for your report, choose Review and Complete.




You can always return to the Cost & Usage Reports section of your Billing and Cost Management console 
to see when your reports were last updated.

Choose the bucket name listed under Amazon S3 bucket. The link opens this bucket in the Amazon 
S3 console.


7.

From the list of objects in the bucket, choose the folder named with the first part of the Report 
path prefix that you noted in step 5. For example, if your Report path prefix is example-report-
prefix/example-report-name, then choose the folder named example-report-prefix.


8.

From the list of objects in the folder, choose the folder named with the second part of the Report 
path prefix that you noted in step 5. For example, if your Report path prefix is example-report-
prefix/example-report-name, then choose the folder named example-report-name. This 
folder contains your report files.




Viewing the latest report version

AWS updates your Cost and Usage Report at least once a day until your charges are finalized. When you 
create a report, you can choose to create new report versions or overwrite the existing report version 
with every update.

If you configured your report to create new report versions with every update, then use the assemblyIdin the manifest file to find the latest report files.

To view your latest report files when you have multiple report versions

1.

Sign in to the Billing and Cost Management console at No alternate text specified



2.

In the navigation pane, choose Cost & Usage Reports.


3.

From your list of reports, choose the name of the report that you want to view.


4.

On the Report Details page, note the Report path prefix.


5.

Choose the bucket name listed under Amazon S3 bucket. The link opens this bucket in the Amazon 
S3 console.


6.

From the list of objects in the bucket, choose the folder named with the first part of the Report 
path prefix that you noted in step 4. For example, if your Report path prefix is example-report-
prefix/example-report-name, then choose the folder named example-report-prefix.


7.

From the list of objects in the folder, choose the folder named with the second part of the Report 
path prefix that you noted in step 4. For example, if your Report path prefix is example-report-
prefix/example-report-name, then choose the folder named example-report-name.


8.

Open the folder named with the latest billing period (in the YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD format).


9.

Open the example-report-name-Manifest.json file.


10.

At the top of the manifest file, note the assemblyId. The assemblyId value corresponds to the name 
of the folder with the latest report files.


11.

Return to the Amazon S3 console page where you’re viewing the folder named with the latest billing 
period.


12.

Open the folder named with the assemblyId value that you noted in step 10. For example, if theassemblyId value is 20210129T123456Z, then open the folder named 20210129T123456Z/. This 
folder contains your latest report files.




Viewing your finalized report

After issuing your invoice at the end of the month, AWS finalizes your report’s usage charges. To 
determine if a line item on your report is final, review the bill/InvoiceId column. If the line item is final, 
then the bill/InvoiceId column is populated with an AWS invoice ID. If the line item is not yet final, then 
the bill/InvoiceId column is blank.

To determine if your entire report is finalized, review the bill/InvoiceId column. If the report is final, 
then the bill/InvoiceId column is populated with invoice ID values. If the report is not yet final, then thebill/InvoiceId column is blank.

Note

After your report is finalized, AWS might update the report if AWS applies refunds, credits, or 
support fees to your usage for the month. Because Developer, Business, and Enterprise Support 
are calculated based on final usage charges, those are reflected on the sixth or seventh of the 
month for the prior month’s report. AWS applies credits or refunds based on the terms of your 
agreement or contract with AWS.

Understanding your report versions

AWS updates your Cost and Usage Report at least once a day until your charges are finalized. When you 
create a report, you can choose to create new report versions or overwrite the existing report version 
with every update.

Your report files include a .csv file or a collection of .csv files and the manifest file. Your report can also 
include any additional files that support your data’s integration with Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift, 
or Amazon QuickSight.

AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
AWS CUR delivery timeline



The following sections describe the file organization and naming conventions based on the report 
versioning that you choose.

Cost and Usage Reports delivery timeline

During the report period, AWS delivers a new report and a new manifest file each time AWS updates the 
report. AWS builds on previous reports until the end of the billing period. After the end of the report 
billing period, AWS generates a new report with none of the information from the previous report.

Creating new Cost and Usage Report versions

When you choose to keep your previous Cost and Usage Reports, your AWS CUR uses the following 
Amazon S3 organization and naming conventions.

<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<assemblyId>/<example-
report-name>-<file-number>.csv.<zip|gz>

•

report-prefix = The prefix that you assign to the report.


•

report-name = The name that you assign to the report.


•

yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd = The range of dates that the report covers. Reports are finalized at the end of 
the date range.


•

assemblyId = An ID that AWS creates each time that the report is updated.


•

file-number = If the update includes a large file, AWS might split it into multiple files. The file-
number tracks the different files in an update.


•

csv = The format of the report files.


•

zip or gz = The type of compression applied to the report files.




For example, your report could be delivered as a collection of the following files.

<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/20160101-20160131/<123456789>/<example-
report-name>-<1>.csv.<zip>
<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/20160101-20160131/<123456789>/<example-
report-name>-<2>.csv.<zip>
<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/20160101-20160131/<123456789>/<example-
report-name>-<3>.csv.<zip>
<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/20160101-20160131/<123456789>/<example-
report-name>-Manifest.json<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/20160101-20160131/<example-report-name>-
Manifest.json

AWS delivers all reports in a report date range to the same report-prefix/report-name/
yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd folder. AWS gives each report a unique ID and delivers it to the assemblyIdsubfolder in the date range folder. If the report is too large for a single file, the report is split into 
multiple files and delivered to the same assemblyId folder.

For more information on manifesting files when you keep a previous report, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified


Overwriting previous Cost and Usage Reports

When you choose to overwrite your previous Cost and Usage Reports, your AWS CUR uses the following 
Amazon S3 organization and naming conventions.

8


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Cost and Usage Reports manifest files



<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-report-name>-
<file-number>.csv.<zip|gz>

•

report-prefix = The prefix that you assign to the report.


•

report-name = The name that you assign to the report.


•

yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd = The range of dates that the report covers. AWS finalizes reports at the end of 
the date range.


•


•

file-number = If the update includes a large file, AWS might split it into multiple files. The file-
number tracks the different files in an update.


•

csv = The format of the report files.


•

zip or gz = The type of compression applied to the report files.




For example, your report could be delivered as a collection of the following files.

<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-report-name>-
<1>.csv.<zip>
<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-report-name>-
<2>.csv.<zip><example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-
report-name>-<3>.csv.<zip>
<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-report-name>-
Manifest.json

Athena specifications

If you chose Athena support when you created your AWS CUR, the file naming conventions are the 
same as when you choose to overwrite your AWS CUR except for the format and compression. Athena 
AWS CUR files use .parquet instead. For example, your report could be delivered as a collection of the 
following files.

<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-report-
name>.parquet<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/
<cost_and_usage_data_status>
<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-report-name>-
Manifest.json<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<example-report-name>-
create-table.sql<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/crawler-cfn.yml

AWS CloudFormation specifications

In addition to the AWS CUR files, AWS also delivers an AWS CloudFormation template that you can 
use to set up an AWS CloudFormation stack that enables you to query Amazon S3 data using Athena. 
If you don't want to use the AWS CloudFormation template, you can use the provided SQL to create 
your own Athena tables. For more information, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

Cost and Usage Reports manifest files

When AWS updates AWS CUR, AWS also creates and delivers manifest files that you can use for Amazon 
Athena, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon QuickSight.

Manifest files use the naming conventions, and lists the following:

All of the detail columns that are included in the report to date


•

A list of report files if the report was split into multiple files


•

The time period covered by the report, and other information.

report-name>-Manifest.json<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/<example-report-name>/year=2018/month=12/
<example-report-name>-Manifest.json

Creating new Cost and Usage Report versions

When you keep the previous Cost and Usage Reports, the manifest file is delivered to both the date 
range folder and the assemblyId folder. Each time AWS creates a new AWS CUR for a date range, it 
overwrites the manifest file stored in the date range folder with an updated manifest file. AWS delivers 
the same updated manifest file to the assemblyId folder along with the files for that update. Manifest 
files in the assemblyId folder aren't overwritten.

Overwriting the previous Cost and Usage Reports

When you overwrite the previous AWS CUR, the manifest file is delivered to the month=mm folder. The 
manifest file is overwritten along with the report files.

Amazon Redshift specifications

If you chose the option for Amazon Redshift support in your AWS CUR, AWS also creates and delivers a 
file with the SQL commands that you need to upload your report into Amazon Redshift. You can open 
the SQL file with a regular text editor. The SQL file uses the following naming convention.

<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/<assemblyId>/<example-
report-name>-RedshiftCommands.sql

If you use the commands in the RedshiftCommands file, you don't need to open theRedshiftManifest file.

Important

The manifest file determines which report files the copy command in theRedshiftCommands file uploads. Deleting or removing the manifest file breaks the copy 
command in the RedshiftCommands file.

Amazon Athena specifications

If you chose the option for Amazon Athena support in your AWS CUR, AWS also creates and delivers 
multiple files to help set up all of the resources that you need. AWS delivers a AWS CloudFormation 
template, a SQL file with the SQL to create your Athena table manually, and a file with the SQL to check 
your AWS CUR refresh status. These files use the following naming conventions.

<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/
crawler-cfn.yml<example-report-prefix>/<example-report-name>/<example-report-name>/yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd/

Editing your Cost and Usage Reports configuration

You can use the Cost & Usage Reports page in the Billing and Cost Management console to edit Cost and 
Usage Reports.

Note

Report names can't be edited. If you chose Overwrite for Report versioning, you're unable to 
edit the report name, whether the report includes resource IDs, time granularity, or the report 
versioning. If you delete a report set to Overwrite and create a new report with the same name, 
Amazon S3 bucket, and path prefix, your data could corrupt and become inaccurate.

To edit Cost and Usage Reports

Using Cost and Usage Reports for AWS 
Organizations

In AWS Organizations, both management accounts and member accounts can create Cost and Usage 
Reports. The IAM policies that allow or restrict the ability to create a report are the same for both types 
of accounts.

Note

The account that creates the Cost and Usage Report must also own the Amazon S3 bucket that 
AWS sends the reports to. Avoid configuring a Cost and Usage Report with a bucket owned by 
another account. For more information the Amazon S3 bucket setup requirements, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

Managing Cost and Usage Reports as a member 
account

If you have permissions to create a Cost and Usage Report for a member account within an organization, 
you can create a report for only the member account’s cost and usage data. The member account 
receives reports for its cost and usage during the time that the account has been a member of its current 
organization.

For example, say a member account leaves organization A and joins organization B on the 15th of the 
month. Then, the member account creates a report. Because the member account created a report after 
joining organization B, the member account’s report for the month includes billing data for only the time 
that the account has been a member of organization B.

After a member account joins a new organization, the member account's cost and usage are recorded in 
the new organization’s reports. This is the same outcome for a management account that converts to a 
member account and joins a new organization.

When a member account leaves an organization or converts into a standalone account, the member 
account can still access the previous reports as long as they have permissions to the Amazon S3 bucket 
where the previous reports are stored.

Managing Cost and Usage Reports as a management 
account

If you’re an administrator of an AWS Organizations management account and you don’t want member 
accounts to create a report, you can apply a service control policy (SCP) that prevents member accounts 
from creating reports. The SCP can prevent member accounts from creating new reports, but it doesn’t 
delete reports created previously.

Note

SCPs apply only to member accounts. To prevent a management account from creating a report, 
modify the IAM policies attached to the user roles in the management account.

For more information on consolidated billing, see No alternate text specified 
in the AWS 
Billing User Guide.

AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Setting up Athena with CloudFormation



Querying Cost and Usage Reports 
using Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena is a serverless query service that you can use to analyze the data from your AWS Cost 
and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. This 
helps you avoid having to create your own data warehouse solutions to query AWS CUR data.

We strongly recommend that you create both a new Amazon S3 bucket and a new AWS CUR report 
to use with Athena. AWS CUR supports only the Apache Parquet compression format for Athena and 
automatically overwrites previous reports that are stored in your S3 bucket.

This section outlines how to use Athena with Cost and Usage Reports. For a full description of the 
Athena service, see the No alternate text specified

Setting up Athena using AWS CloudFormation 
templates

Important

AWS CloudFormation doesn't support cross-Region resources. If you plan to use an AWS 
CloudFormation template, you must create all resources in the same AWS Region. The Region 
must support the following services:

•

AWS Lambda


•

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)


•

AWS Glue


•

Amazon Athena




To streamline and automate integration of your Cost and Usage Reports with Athena, AWS provides an 
AWS CloudFormation template with several key resources along with the reports that you set up for 
Athena integration. The AWS CloudFormation template includes an AWS Glue crawler, an AWS Glue 
database, and an AWS Lambda event.

The Athena integration setup process using AWS CloudFormation removes any Amazon S3 events that 
your bucket might already have. This can negatively affect any existing event-based processes that you 

13


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide

have for an existing AWS CUR report. We strongly recommend that you create both a new Amazon S3 
bucket and a new AWS CUR report to use with Athena.

Before you can use a CloudFormation template to automate Athena integration, make sure that you do 
the following:

•

Create a new Amazon S3 bucket for your reports. For more information, see No alternate text specified 
in theAmazon S3 User Guide.


•

No alternate text specified

Setting up Athena manually

We strongly recommend that you use the AWS CloudFormation template to create your table instead of 
creating it yourself. The provided SQL query creates a table that covers only a single month of data, but 
the AWS CloudFormation template creates a table that can include multiple months and that updates 
automatically. For more information on how to set up the AWS CloudFormation template, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

If you choose not to use the AWS CloudFormation template to set up your Athena table, manually follow 
the steps below. You need to create a table before you can run SQL queries on your AWS CUR data. You 
will need to do this step at least once a month and the table only includes data from the current AWS 
CUR.

As part of the table creation process, AWS transforms the AWS CUR column names. For more 
information about the transformation process, see No alternate text specified

Creating a Cost and Usage Reports status table

AWS refreshes your AWS CUR multiple times a day. There isn't a way for Athena to tell when AWS is in 
the process of refreshing your report, which can lead to query results with a combination of old and new 
data. To mitigate this, create a table to track whether AWS is refreshing your Cost and Usage Reports and 
query that table to see if AWS is refreshing your data. You only need to create this table once. After that, 
AWS keeps the table up to date.

To create your refresh table

1.

Open the Athena console at No alternate text specified
.


2.

In the New query 1 query pane, paste the following SQL.

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cost_and_usage_data_status( 
status STRING)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 
'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe'WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( 
'serialization.format' = '1'
)
LOCATION 's3://{S3_Bucket_Name}/{Report_Key}/cost_and_usage_data_status/'


3.

Choose Run query.




To check whether AWS is refreshing your data, use the Athena console to run the following SQL query.

select status from cost_and_usage_data_status 

Uploading your report partitions

To query your Cost and Usage Reports data, you need to upload the data into your Athena table. You 
must do this for each new AWS CUR report that AWS delivers to you.

To upload your latest partitions

1.

Open the Athena console at No alternate text specified
.




16


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Running Athena queries



2.

Choose the ... next to your table.


3.

Choose Load Partitions.




If you don't upload your partitions, Athena returns either no results or an error message that indicates 
missing data.

Running Amazon Athena queries

To run Athena queries on your data, first use the Athena console to check whether AWS is refreshing your 
data and then run your query on the Athena console. When you run your SQL, make sure that the correct 
database is selected from the dropdown list. You can use the following SQL to check the status.

select status from cost_and_usage_data_status 

The two possible results are READY and UPDATING. If the status is READY, then you can query your 
Athena database. If the status is UPDATING, then Athena might return incomplete results.

After you've confirmed that AWS is refreshing your data, you can run your own queries. For example, 
the following query shows year-to-date costs by service for each month in the example database calledmycostandusage_parquet. The following query shows 2018 year-to-date costs. Update the year to 
see current year-to-date costs.

SELECT line_item_product_code,
sum(line_item_blended_cost) AS cost, monthFROM mycostandusage_parquetWHERE year='2018'
GROUP BY line_item_product_code, monthHAVING sum(line_item_blended_cost) > 0ORDER BY line_item_product_code;

Column names

Athena column name restrictions are different from the Cost and Usage Reports column name 
restrictions. This means that when your AWS CUR data is uploaded into an Athena table, the column 
names change. AWS makes the following changes:

•

An underscore is added in front of uppercase letters


•

Uppercase letters are replaced with lowercase letters


•

Any non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with an underscore


•

Duplicate underscores are removed


•

Any leading and trailing underscores are removed


•

If the column name is longer than the allowed length of column names, underscores are removed from 
left to right




Note

After applying these rules, some of the resource tag columns will have duplicate names. AWS 
merges columns when there are more than one columns with the same name.

For example, the column name ExampleColumnName : Example Column Name Continuedbecomes example_column_name_example_column_name_continued.

Loading report data to Amazon QuickSight

You can upload your Cost and Usage Reports into Amazon QuickSight.

For more information about uploading to Amazon QuickSight, see No alternate text specified 
in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide.

Loading report data to Amazon Redshift

This section shows how you can upload AWS CUR to Amazon Redshift to analyze your AWS costs and 
usage.

Important

Amazon Redshift columns aren't case sensitive and has stricter character limitations than 
user-defined tags. To prevent conflicts between Amazon Redshift and user-defined tags, AWS 
replaces your tags with the tags userTag0, userTag1, userTag2, etc. After you create an 
Amazon Redshift table and upload your report into it, you can create an Amazon Redshift table 
that maps the AWS-defined tags to your user-defined tags. The tag table allows you to look up 
your original tags.

For example, if you have the tags OWNER and Owner, Amazon Redshift doesn't allow you to 
create a table with two columns named "owner". Instead, you create a report table with the 
columns userTag0 and userTag1 instead of OWNER and Owner, and then create a table with 
the columns remappedUserTag and userTag. The remappedUserTag column stores the 
AWS-defined tags userTag0 and userTag1, and the userTag column stores your original tags,
OWNER and Owner

AWS provides the commands to create your Amazon Redshift table, upload your report, create your 
tag table, and insert all of the tag rows into your tag table. The commands are provided to you in theRedshiftCommands.sql file that is stored alongside your manifest file in S3, and in the Redshift fileHelper file in the Billing and Cost Management console. AWS also provides a RedshiftManifest file, which 
controls which report the commands in the RedshiftCommand file uploads. Deleting or removing the 
RedshiftManifest file breaks the copy command in the RedshiftCommands file.

Differences between Billing Conductor 
AWS CUR and standard AWS CUR



Configuring Cost and Usage Reports 
using Billing Conductor pro forma 
billing data

You can create pro forma AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) for each billing group that you create 
in Billing Conductor. The pro forma AWS CUR has the same file format, granularity, and columns as the

Understanding the differences between Billing 
Conductor AWS CUR and standard AWS CUR

There are a few differences between the standard Cost and Usage Reports and pro forma AWS CUR 
created using the Billing Conductor configuration.

•

The standard AWS CUR computes the cost and usage for each account in your consolidated billing 
family. A pro forma AWS CUR per billing group only includes the accounts in the billing group at the 
time of computation.


•

The standard AWS CUR populates the invoice column once and invoice is generated by AWS. A pro 
forma AWS CUR doesn't populate the invoice column. Currently, no invoice is generated, or issued by 
AWS based on pro forma billing data.

Identity details

Columns under the identity header in AWS Cost and Usage Reports are static fields that appear in all

You can use the identity line items in the report to find specific line items that have been split across 
multiple AWS CUR files. These include the following columns:

identity/LineItemId

•

Description: This field is generated for each line item and is unique in a given partition. This does not 
guarantee that the field will be unique across an entire delivery (that is, all partitions in an update) of 
the AWS CUR. The line item ID isn't consistent between different Cost and Usage Reports and can't be 
used to identify the same line item across different reports.

Understanding Savings Plans

You can use Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) to track your Savings Plans utilization, charges, and 
allocations.

Savings Plans line items

Savings Plans provide a flexible pricing model that offers low prices on Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, 
AWS Lambda, and Amazon SageMaker in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage 
(measured in $/hour) for a 1-year or 3-year term.

The following line items in AWS CUR help you track and manage your spend with Savings Plans.

Note

In the following tables, the columns and rows from AWS CUR are transposed for clarity. The 
values in the first column represent the headers of a report. These examples include only 
a few key AWS CUR columns. To learn more about other AWS CUR columns, see the No alternate text specified

RI discount benefits

The Discounted Usage line item describes the instance usage that received a matching RI discount 
benefit, and is added to your bill when you have usage that matches one of your RIs. AWS calculates 
RI discount benefits based on matching usage: for example, the use of an instance that matches the 
instance reservation. If you have matching usage, the cost associated with the usage line item is always 
zero because the charges associated with RIs are already accounted for in the two other line items (the 
upfront fee and the recurring monthly charges).

The following table shows an example of usage that received an RI discount benefit.

The value for UsageAmount in the Amazon EC2 DiscountedUsage line is the actual number of hours 
used. The value for NormalizedUsageAmount is the value for UsageAmount multiplied by the value forNormalizationFactor. The value for NormalizationFactor is determined by the instance size. When an 
RI benefit discount is applied to a matching line item of usage, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value 
in the reservation/ReservationARN column for the initial upfront fees and recurring monthly charges 
matches the ARN value in the discounted usage line items.

For more information about mapping instance size to normalization factor, see No alternate text specified 
in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

Reserved Instance type

To determine if your report line items are associated with a Standard Reserved Instance or a Convertible 
Reserved Instance, filter the lineItem/LineItemType column by Fee or RI fee. Then, review the product/
OfferingClass column, which indicates the Reserved Instance type.

72


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Understanding your amortized reservation data



To determine if your report line items are associated with a zonal or regional Reserved Instance, 
review the reservation/AvailabilityZone column. For zonal Reserved Instances, this column shows the 
corresponding Availability Zone. For regional Reserved Instances, this column is empty.

Reserved Instance benefits applied to instance usage

To understand which instance usage line items benefitted from which Reserved Instances, you can filter 
your report by one or more of the following columns:

•

reservation/reservationARN: Filter this column by a reservation ARN to identify which Reserved 
Instance lease is associated with each line item.


•

lineitem/ResourceId: Review this column for the ID of the resource that's covered by the Reserved 
Instance.


•

lineitem/LineItemType: Filter this column by Fee, RI fee, or DiscountedUsage to determine the 
associated fees or benefits.


•

lineitem/UsageType: Filter this column by HeavyUsage to identify RI fee line items. Or, filter this 
column by BoxUsage to identify DiscountedUsage line items.


•

lineitem/UsageAmount: For RI fee line items, this column shows the total number of hours in the 
month that the Reserved Instance was applied. For DiscountedUsage line items, this column shows 
the total number of hours that the Reserved Instance was applied to a specific instance at the daily or 
monthly level, depending on how you configured your report.




To understand a size flexible Reserved Instance’s number of normalized units applied to instance usage, 
review the lineitem/NormalizedUsageAmount column in your report. The value in this column equals 
the product of the following columns:

•

lineitem/UsageAmount: This column shows the metered instance usage measured in hours.


•

lineItem/NormalizationFactor: For DiscountedUsage and RI fee line items, this column shows the 
associated normalization factor of the instance. For more information on the normalization factor, seeNo alternate text specified 
in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux 
Instances.




For AWS Organizations with multiple accounts, to see which accounts purchased or benefitted from a 
Reserved Instance, review the following columns:

•

reservation/reservationARN: Review the reservation ARNs to see which accounts purchased the 
Reserved Instance. The ARN includes the account ID.


•

lineitem/UsageAccountId: For DiscountedUsage line items, this column identifies the account IDs 
that received benefits from the purchased Reserved Instances.




Note

A Reserved Instance is a billing subscription and not a resource like an Amazon EC2 instance. 
Because of this, Reserved Instances that are tagged don't populate line items like a tagged 
resource. For line items with DiscountedUsage, tags populate for the tagged resources and not 
for the Reserved Instance.

To identify costs associated with a specific Reserved Instance lease, you can filter Fee or RI feeline items by the Reserved Instance ARN, which is the lease ID. To organize your cost data for 
Reserved Instances, consider using AWS Cost Categories. For more information, see No alternate text specified 
in the AWS Billing User Guide

Understanding your amortized reservation data

Amortizing is when you distribute one-time reservation costs across the billing period that is affected 
by that cost. Amortizing enables you to see your costs in accrual-based accounting as opposed to

cash-based accounting. For example, if you pay $365 for an All Upfront RI for one year and you have a 
matching instance that uses that RI, that instance costs you $1 a day, amortized.

You can see the data that Billing and Cost Management uses to calculate your amortized costs in the

Monitoring your size flexible reservations for Amazon 
EC2

Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances that apply to a Region provide Availability Zone flexibility and instance 
size flexibility. Reserved Instances that provide Availability Zone flexibility provide a discount on usage 
in any Availability Zone in the Region. Reserved Instances that provide instance size flexibility provide 
a discount on usage, regardless of instance size in that family. Size flexible Reserved Instances apply to 
the smallest instance sizes first. For more information, see No alternate text specified 
in theAmazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

To understand how instance size flexibility provided by your Reserved Instance is applied to your usage, 
refer to the lineItem/NormalizationFactor and lineItem/NormalizedUsageAmount columns.

Note

Instance size flexibility is supported only by Linux or Unix Reserved Instances with default 
tenancy that are assigned to a Region. For more information on the limitations of instance size 
flexibility for Regional Reserved Instances, see No alternate text specified 
in 
the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

In a Cost and Usage Report, the Reserved Instance usage is applied by default to the account that 
purchased the Reserved Instance. Any available Reserved Instance benefit that the purchasing account 
can’t use within the hour is then applied to other linked accounts based on the available matching On-
Demand Instance usage.

Example

You purchase one m4.xlarge RI in a given Region. This m4.xlarge RI can be applied automatically to 
all m4 instance usage in the same Region. In the following table, AWS applied the m4.xlarge to two 
separate m4.large instances.

Monitoring your On-Demand capacity reservations

Capacity reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances for any duration in 
a specific Availability Zone. This enables you to create and manage capacity reservations separately from 
the billing discounts offered by Regional Reserved Instances (RI). To benefit from billing discounts, you 
can use Regional RIs in combination with capacity reservations.

Capacity reservation line items

You can use some columns defined in the AWS CUR data dictionary to track your capacity reservations. 
The following columns are also used for capacity reservations.

This section defines these line items with supplementary definitions specific to capacity reservations.

B

lineItem/BlendedRate

For capacity reservations with a UsageType of Reservation or DedicatedRes, the BlendedRate is 0. This 
is because the capacity reservation costs are associated with the instance that provides the capacity, 
instead of with the capacity reservation itself.

76


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Monitoring your On-Demand capacity reservations



R

lineItem/ResourceId

If you included lineItem/ResourceId when you created your Cost and Usage Reports, you can 
identify and track your capacity reservations using the ResourceId column. The capacity reservationResourceId is captured only for the UnusedBox, UnusedDed, Reservation, and DedicatedResUsageTypes.

Capacity reservations always include a cr- in their resource ID, and the resource ID has the following 
format:

arn:aws:ec2:<region>:<account id>:<capacity-reservation>/cr-0be443example1db6f

U

lineItem/UnblendedCost

The BlendedRate multiplied by the UsageAmount.

lineItem/UnblendedRate

For capacity reservations with a UsageType of Reservation or DedicatedRes, the UnblendedRate is 0. 
This is because the costs for capacity reservations are associated with the instance that provides the 
capacity, instead of with the capacity reservation itself.

lineItem/UsageAmount

How much of a capacity reservation you've used. Each capacity reservation can have multiple slots for an 
hour, enabling you to run more than one instance that uses the reservation during an hour. Therefore, it's 
possible to use more than one instance-hour in an hour. UsageAmount is calculated by multiplying the 
number of instance slots covered by the line item with the number of hours covered by the line item.

lineItem/UsageType

How much of a specific reservation you've used. For Amazon EC2, the options are as follows:

lineItem/lineitemtype = BoxUsage

For this UsageType, the UsageAmount column is the amount of instance-hours of an instance you've 
used.

For example, a report covers 1 hour and has a capacity reservation line item that can cover 10 instances. 
If you use two instance-slots during the time period covered by the report, the BoxUsage UsageAmountcovers the number of instance hours that you reserved and used. In this case, this is two (the number of 
used instance slots) multiplied by 1 hour (the time covered by the report) for a total of two. For a report 
that covers 1 day, the UsageAmount is two multiplied by 24, for a total of 48.

DedicatedRes

For a UsageType of DedicatedRes, the UsageAmount column describes how many instance-hours of a 
dedicated capacity reservation you reserved.

Reservation

For a UsageType of Reservation, the UsageAmount column describes how many instance-hours of a 
capacity reservation you reserved.

77


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Understanding data transfer charges



For example, if a report covers one hour and has a capacity reservation line item that can cover 10 
instances, the Reservation UsageAmount covers the number of instance slots that you reserved. In this 
case, that's 10 (the number of available instance slots) multiplied by 1 hour (the time covered by the 
report) for a total of 10. For a report that covers 1 day, the UsageAmount would be 10 multiplied by 24, 
for a total of 240.

UnusedBox

For a UsageType of UnusedBox, the UsageAmount column describes how many instance-hours of a 
capacity reservation you reserved, but didn't use.

For example, a report covers 1 hour and has a capacity reservation line item that can cover 10 instances. 
If you didn't use eight instance-slots during the time period covered by the report, the UnusedBoxUsageAmount covers the number of instance hours that you reserved but didn't use. In this case, that's 
eight (the number of unused instance slots) multiplied by 1 hour (the time covered by the report) for a 
total of eight. For a report that covers 1 day, the UsageAmount is eight multiplied by 24, for a total of 
192.

UnusedDed

For a UsageType of UnusedDed, the UsageAmount column describes how many instance-hours of a 
dedicated capacity reservation that you reserved, but didn't use.

Understanding data transfer charges

You can identify your AWS data transfer charges using the No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified 
column of your 
AWS CUR.

Note

Data transfer charges can vary depending on the services used and the source AWS Region. For 
detailed pricing information, refer to the service’s pricing page. For example, see No alternate text specified 
for detailed pricing information about Amazon EC2 data transfer.

Data transfer within an AWS Region

Data transfer between Availability Zones in the same AWS Region have a UsageType of Region-
DataTransfer-Regional-Bytes. For example, the USE2-DataTransfer-Regional-Bytes usage 
type identifies charges for data transfer between Availability Zones in the US East (Ohio) Region.

For a given resource, you’re charged for both inbound and outbound traffic in a data transfer within an 
AWS Region. This means for each resource metered, you'll see two DataTransfer-Regional-Bytesline items for each data transfer. Confirm the service's pricing page for more information, because some 
services have in-Region traffic at no cost.

Data transfer between AWS Regions

Data transfer between different AWS Regions can have the following usage types:

•

Source Region-Destination Region-AWS-In-Bytes


•

Source Region-Destination Region-AWS-Out-Bytes


•

Source Region-AWS-In-Bytes


•

Source Region-AWS-Out-Bytes




For each resource, data transfer between AWS Regions corresponds to two line items in your report:

78


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Data transfer out to the internet



•

A line item for the data transferred into the destination Region


•

A line item for the data transferred out from the source Region




There's no charge for the data transferred into the destination Region. The data transfer charge is 
determined by the data transferred out from the source Region.

For example, a data transfer from the USE2 Region to the APS3 Region will have both a APS3-USE2-
AWS-In-Bytes line item and a USE2-APS3-AWS-Out-Bytes line item. The USE2-APS3-AWS-In-
Bytes line item has no corresponding charge. The data transfer charge is associated with the USE2-
APS3-AWS-Out-Bytes line item.

Data transfer out to the internet

Data transfer from AWS to the internet have a UsageType of Region-DataTransfer-Out-Bytes. For 
example, the USE2-DataTransfer-Out-Bytes usage type identifies charges for data transfer from 
the USE2 Region to the internet.

There’s no charge for data transfer from the internet to AWS.

Note

Data transfer usage types that don’t have the Region prefix, such as DataTransfer-
Regional-Bytes or DataTransfer-Out-Bytes, represent data transfer from the US East (N. 
Virginia) Region.

AWS Direct Connect traffic

AWS Direct Connect data transfer over a public virtual interface have usage types that end withDataXfer-In or DataXfer-Out.

AWS Direct Connect data transfer over a private virtual interface have usage types that end withDataXfer-In:dc.1 or DataXfer-Out:dc.1.

S3 Transfer Acceleration traffic

Amazon S3 data transfer using S3 Transfer Acceleration have usage types that contain ABytes:

•

Between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2: Usage types that end with C3DataTransfer-In-ABytes orC3DataTransfer-Out-ABytes


•

Between Amazon S3 and the internet: Usage types that end with DataTransfer-In-ABytes orDataTransfer-Out-ABytes


•

Between Amazon S3 and CloudFront: Usage types that end with CloudFront-In-ABytes orCloudFront-Out-ABytes


•

Between Amazon S3 buckets in different AWS Regions: Usage type of Source Region-Destination 
Region-AWS-Out-ABytes




CloudFront traffic

CloudFront data transfer have a usage type of Region-DataTransfer-Out-Bytes or Region-
DataTransfer-Out-OBytes coupled with the product code AmazonCloudFront. The Region prefix in 
the usage type refers to the CloudFront Edge location used in the data transfer.

Tip

Use the No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified 
column to distinguish CloudFront data transfer from data 
transfer out to the internet. The usage types for these data transfer types look similar.

AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Understanding split cost allocation data



Understanding split cost allocation data

You can use Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) to track your Amazon ECS container costs. Using split 
cost allocation data, you can allocate your container costs to individual business units and teams, based 
on how your container workloads consume shared compute and memory resources. Split cost allocation 
data introduces cost and usage data for new container-level resources (that is, ECS tasks) to AWS CUR. 
Previously, AWS CUR only supported costs at the EC2 instance level. Split cost allocation data generates 
container-level costs by looking at each container’s EC2 instance resource consumption, and generates 
cost based on the amortized cost of the instance and the percentage of CPU and memory resources 
consumed by the containers that ran on the instance.

Split cost allocation data introduces new usage records and new cost metric columns for each 
containerized resource ID (that is, ECS task) in AWS CUR. For more information, see No alternate text specified
.

When including split cost allocation data in AWS CUR, two new usage records are added for each ECS 
task per hour in order to reflect the CPU and memory costs. To estimate the number of new line items in 
AWS CUR per day, use the following formula:

(number of tasks * average task lifetime * 2) * 24

For example, if you have 1,000 tasks running each hour across a cluster of 10 EC2 instances and the 
lifetime for the task is less than 1 hour, then:

(1000 * 1 * 2) * 24 = 48,000 new usage records in AWS CUR

Note

When it comes to AWS cost allocation tags, you can use Amazon ECS-managed tags or user-
added tags for your Cost and Usage Reports. These tags apply to all new split cost allocation 
data usage records. For more information, see No alternate text specified
.

Enabling split cost allocation data

It is a prerequisite to opt in to split cost allocation data through the AWS Cost Management preferences.

To opt in to split cost allocation data

1.

Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Cost Management console at No alternate text specified
.


2.

In the navigation pane, choose Preferences.


3.

Under AWS Cost Explorer, select Split cost allocation data.




Note

Only regular and payer accounts have access to the AWS Cost Management preferences and can 
opt in to split cost allocation data. Once opted in, member accounts can view the data in the 
Cost and Usage Reports.

Once you’ve opted in, you can choose to have cost and usage data for container-level resources included 
in your report during step one of report creation or later by editing the report details.

To include cost and usage data in your report

1.

Sign in to the Billing and Cost Management console at No alternate text specified



2.

In the navigation pane, choose Cost & Usage Reports.


3.

Whether creating a new report or editing an existing report, in the Specify report details page, 
under Report content, select Split cost allocation data.




80


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Example of split cost allocation data



Note

You can also use the AWS CUR API or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage your 
split cost allocation data preferences.

Split cost allocation data enables cost visibility for all Amazon ECS container objects across your entire 
consolidated billing family (payer and linked accounts). Once activated, split cost allocation data 
automatically scans for tasks and containers. It ingests the telemetry usage data for your container 
workloads and prepares the granular cost data for the current month.

Note

It can take up to 24 hours for the data to be visible in AWS CUR.

For information about managing access to Billing and Cost Management console pages, see No alternate text specified
.

For information regarding AWS Cost Management preferences and controlling access to Cost Explorer, 
see No alternate text specified
.

Example of split cost allocation data

The aim of the following example is to show you how split cost allocation data is calculated by 
computing the cost of individual ECS services and tasks running on the cluster. Note that the rates used 
throughout the example are for illustrative purposes only.

You have the following usage in a single hour:

•

Single instance (m5.xlarge) shared cluster with two services and four tasks, running for the duration of 
a full hour.


•

Instance configuration is 4 vCPU and 16 GB of memory.


•

Amortized cost of the instance is $1/hr.




Split cost allocation data uses relative unit weights for CPU and memory based on a 9:1 ratio. This is 
derived from per vCPU per hour and per GB per hour prices in No alternate text specified
.

Step 1: Compute the unit cost for CPU and memory

Unit-cost-per-resource = Hourly-instance-cost/((Memory-weight * Memory-
available) + (CPU-weight * CPU-available))

= $1/( (1 * 16GB) + (9 * 4vCPU)) = $0.02

Cost-per-vCPU-hour = CPU-weight * Unit-cost-per-resource

= 9 * $0.02 = $0.17

Cost-per-GB-hour = Memory-weight * Unit-cost-per-resource

= 1 * $0.02 = $0.02

Example of split cost allocation data



Step 2: Compute the allocated capacity and instance unused 
capacity

•

Allocated capacity: The memory and vCPU allocated to the ECS task from the parent EC2 instance, 
defined as the maximum of used and reserved capacity.

Note

If memory or vCPU usage data is unavailable, reservation data will be used instead. For more 
information, see No alternate text specified
.


•

Instance unused capacity: The unused capacity of vCPU and memory.




Task1-Allocated-vCPU = Max (1 vCPU, 0.1 vCPU) = 1 vCPU

Task1-Allocated-memory = Max (4 GB, 3 GB) = 4 GB

Instance-Unused-vCPU = Max (CPU-available - SUM(Allocated-vCPU), 0) = Max (4 – 4.9, 
0) = 0

Instance-Unused-memory = Max (Memory-available - SUM(Allocated-memory), 0) = Max 
(16 – 14, 0) = 2 GB

In this example, the instance has CPU over subscription, attributed to Task2 that used more vCPU than 
what was reserved.

Step 3: Compute the split usage ratios

•

Split usage ratio: The percentage of CPU or memory used by the ECS task compared to the overall CPU 
or memory available on the EC2 instance.


•

Unused ratio: The percentage of CPU or memory used by the ECS task compared to the overall CPU 
or memory used on the EC2 instance (that is, not factoring in the unused CPU or memory on the 
instance).




Task1-vCPU-split-usage-ratio = Allocated-vCPU / Total-vCPU

= 1 vCPU / 4.9vCPU = 0.204

Task1-Memory-split-usage-ratio = Allocated-GB / Total-GB

= 4 GB/ 16GB = 0.250

82


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide

Task1-vCPU-unused-ratio = Task1-vCPU-split-usage-ratio / (Total-CPU-split-
usage-ratio – Instance-unused-CPU) (set to 0 if Instance-unused-CPU is 0)

= 0 (since Instance-unused-CPU is 0)

Task1-Memory-unused-ratio = Task1-Memory-split-usage-ratio / (Total-Memory-
split-usage-ratio – Instance-unused-memory) (set to 0 if Instance-unused-memory is 0)

Step 4: Compute the split cost and unused costs

•

Split cost: The pay per use cost allocation of the EC2 instance cost based on allocated CPU and 
memory usage by the ECS task.


•

Unused instance cost: The cost of unused CPU or memory resources on the instance.




Task1-Split-cost = (Task1-vCPU-split-usage-ratio * vCPU-available * Cost-per-
vCPU-hour) + (Task1-Memory-split-usage-ratio * Memory-available * Cost-per-GB-
hour)

= (0.204 * 4 vCPU * $0.17) + (0.25 * 16GB * $0.02) = $0.22

Task1-Unused-cost = (Task1-vCPU-unused-ratio * Instance-vCPU-unused-ratio * 
vCPU-available * Cost-per-VCPU-hour) + (Task1-Memory-unused-ratio * Instance-
Memory-unused ratio * Memory-available * Cost-per-GB-hour)

= (0 * 0 * 4 * $0.17) + (0.286 * 0.125 * 16 * $0.02) = $0.01

the EC2 instance usage is billed at On-Demand rates, EC2 instance amortized costs are computed using 
savingsPlan/SavingsPlanEffectiveCost (for SavingsPlanCoveredUsage) + lineItem/UnblendedCost (for 
On-Demand usage).

Detailed Billing Reports

Important

The Detailed Billing Reports feature is unavailable for new customers as of July 8, 2019.

Detailed Billing Reports (DBR) contain similar information to AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) 
regarding your charges, but calculates the individual line items differently. If you've signed up for both 
the DBR and AWS CUR, the line items don't match. However, when the reports are finalized at the end of 
the month, the total cost will align.

AWS stores DBR in Amazon S3 as CSV files using the following naming convention:

AWS account number-aws-billing-detailed-line-items-yyyy-mm.csv.zip

AWS recreates Detailed Billing Reports (DBR) multiple times a day, overwriting the reports. When AWS 
overwrites reports, line items might be in a different order than they were in previous reports. A final 
report is created at the end of the month. For the next month, AWS creates a new report file instead of 
overwriting the final report from the previous month. Reports for previous months remain in your S3 
bucket until you delete them.

For information on how to migrate your DBR to AWS CUR, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

Migrating from Detailed Billing Reports to Cost 
and Usage Reports

Detailed Billing Reports (DBR) and AWS Cost and Usage Reports (AWS CUR) both provide information 
about your charges. However, if you're using DBR, we recommend you transfer your report to Cost and 
Usage Reports.

Comparing benefits of the Cost 
and Usage Reports (AWS CUR)



Comparing benefits of the Cost and Usage Reports 
(AWS CUR)

AWS CUR provides the most comprehensive source of information. You can use AWS CUR to understand 
individual costs in depth, and to analyze them in greater detail. This is especially useful at an enterprise 
scale. AWS CUR is helpful if you have complex cost management needs and require dedicated query 
or analytic-based systems. AWS CUR also provides detailed information about Reserved Instances (RI), 
including amortized costs.

Comprehensive reservation information

Reserved Instances (RI), or reservations, offer a discounted hourly rate compared to On-Demand usage 
in exchange for committing to a one- or three-year term of service. This can result in significant savings. 
You can use AWS CUR to monitor and manage your reservation portfolio. AWS CUR provides you with 
detailed information, such as reservation Amazon Resource Numbers (ARNs), numbers of reservations, 
and total RIs. You can track your reservation-related discounts to specific resources to build a better 
understanding of your savings.

Detail Billing Reports (DBR) provide a subset of this metadata, but work is required to transform the 
required columns.

AWS CUR provides additional columns that are not available in DBR, such as information regarding your 
amortized reservation costs. For more information, see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

On-Demand pricing availability

AWS CUR provides information regarding the On-Demand rates for each individual line item of usage. 
You can use this information to quantify your savings by subtracting the amount you paid from the 
On-Demand rate. This also gives you the flexibility of choosing to allocate your costs using public On-
Demand rates.

DBR doesn’t contain information for On-Demand rates, but only the billed amount. This makes it difficult 
to calculate your overall savings or to allocate costs using On-Demand rates.

Granular breakdown of discounts

AWS CUR can access a granular view of the usage-based discounts. If discounts were applied, you can use 
AWS CUR to view the following:

•

Cost before being discounted


•

Discounted amount


•

Total cost after the discount was applied at the line item level




DBR does not contain a granular breakdown of your discounts.

Automated data ingestion at scale

When you use AWS CUR, you can easily configure an event to trigger an automated data ingestion 
process, streamlining the process of refreshing the billing data in your in-house systems. AWS CUR data 
can automatically be refreshed when charges related to previous months are detected.

Additionally, AWS CUR is generated as multiple files, providing the added benefit of segmenting the 
data into smaller pieces. This way, you can ingest the data according to the processes used by multiple 
workers. Moreover, you can retry data downloads in smaller pieces.

AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Key differences between Detailed Billing 
Reports and Cost and Usage Reports



AWS CUR is formatted in a way that enables you to locate and extract data quickly. This report is 
modeled from a manifest file that contains information for the overall structure of the data. This 
includes a list of every column that's contained in the report. Using this information, you can extend the 
report and include new information regarding your usage when it becomes available.

Cross-product integration

AWS CUR is integrated with Amazon Redshift, Amazon QuickSight, and Amazon Athena. You can use 
AWS CUR to build an AWS-based cost management solution. AWS CUR also provides data in Parquet 
format. This provides you with more options for building out your own cost and usage reporting system. 
For more information, see No alternate text specified 
in the AWS Billing User Guide.

Key differences between Detailed Billing Reports and 
Cost and Usage Reports

There are a few differences between DBR and AWS CUR to consider after you migrate to AWS CUR. For 
example, you might need to adjust how you ingest the data into your systems.

File structure

Detailed Billing Reports (DBR) are delivered as a single file. In contrast, AWS CUR are a consolidated set 
of files. In AWS CUR, you can view the following files in your Amazon S3 bucket:

•

A set of data files that contain all of your usage line items


•

A separate data file that contains all of your discounts (if applicable)


•

A manifest file that lists all of the data files that belong to a single report




Column structure

DBR have a fixed list of columns, limiting its flexibility. AWS CUR don't have a fixed column structure, and 
instead allow you to freely add or remove columns as needed. When you begin using a new AWS service, 
AWS CUR can dynamically start to include new data in the report that might be useful in your case. The 
manifest file provides a map of all columns present in the report.

AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
Scenario 1: RI usage is 100%



Note

In the following tables, the columns and rows from AWS CUR and DBR/DBR-RT are transposed 
for clarity. The values in the first column represent the headers of a report.

Scenario 1: RI usage is 100%

RI Fee line item has $0 unused cost and 0 usage hours.

Using the DBR/DBR-RT, you can understand your unused RI usage and costs by referring to the fields 
UsageQuantity and UnblendedCosts for RI Fee line items. RI Fee line items can be identified by the 
existence of ‘purchased hours’ information in the ItemDescription field. Table 1 illustrates the columns 
and information used to manage unused RI costs in the DBR and DBR-RT report.

In addition to matching the current functionality supported by DBR/DBR-RT, AWS CUR has the following 
advantages:

•

Using AWS CUR, you are able to access information regarding the EffectiveCost for the 
DiscountedUsage line item, which includes both the recurring and upfront fees. The DBR only accounts 
for recurring fees.


•

In AWS CUR, the UsageType field is not transformed for the DiscountedUsage line items whereas DBR 
replaces the information with RI Fee line item information. This is because the user can group line 
items in AWS CUR by ReservationARN in order to understand what usage was discounted by which RI.


•

In AWS CUR, the LineItemDescription field is not transformed for the RI Fee line item. DBR appends 
the hours purchased and hours used.




Scenario 2: Partial RI usage

RI Fee line item has unused cost and usage.

Using the DBR/DBR-RT, you can understand your unused RI usage and costs by referring to fields 
UsageQuantity and UnblendedCosts for RI Fee line items. Table 3 illustrates the columns and 
information used to manage unused RI costs in the DBR and DBR-RT report.

•

AWS CUR has the NormalizedUsageAmount and quantity. The DBR / DBR-RT do not have columns 
representing this.


•

AWS CUR UsageType and Operation are not transformed for the DiscountedUsage lineitem. The DBR / 
DBR-RT replaces these values with the RI Fee line item.


•

AWS CUR LineItemDescription is not transformed for the DiscountedUsage line item. In DBR / DBR-RT, 
which replaces with the RI Fee line item description and appends the DiscountedUsage line item Usage 
Type to the end of the string i.e. “USD 0.10 hourly fee per Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC), c3:8xlarge;

Monthly report

You can download a monthly report of your estimated AWS charges from the Bills page of the Billing 
and Cost Management console.

Suppose that you use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations. Then, this report is available 
only for a management account and includes activity for all the member accounts. Member account 
owners can obtain the monthly report only from the management account. For more information, seeNo alternate text specified 
in the AWS Billing User Guide.

The report contains line items for each unique combination of AWS product, usage type, and operation 
that the account uses. The estimated report is updated several times per day. You can get reports for 
previous months by selecting the statement period. Start with the report for the month when you signed 
up for monthly reports. Reports from before you signed up are not available.

Monthly cost allocation report



Monthly cost allocation report

Important

The monthly cost allocation report feature will be unavailable at a later date. We recommend 
that you use the AWS Cost and Usage Reports instead.

You can create custom cost allocation tag sets for your AWS resources that can describe the business 
dimensions of your AWS usage. You can use these tag sets to organize and track your AWS costs. Many 
AWS services expose tagging in their feature sets. You create the tags within those services by using the 
console, API, or the AWS command line interface (CLI). For more information, see No alternate text specified 
in the AWS Billing User Guide.

After you create your tags, you can obtain a monthly cost allocation report. This is essentially a monthly 
report that includes your cost allocation tag sets.

AWS Usage Report

Important

On September 15, 2023, the AWS Usage Report will no longer provide access to usage data 
older than March 1, 2019. To access such usage data, download historical usage and save it 
locally before September 15, 2023. The AWS Usage Report feature will be unavailable at a later 
date. We recommend that you use AWS Cost and Usage Reports instead.

You can download a usage report in XML or CSV format. Your report covers a single service, based on 
usage type, operation, and time period. You can also choose how the data is aggregated.

To download a usage report

1.

Sign in to the Billing and Cost Management console at No alternate text specified



2.

In the navigation pane, choose Cost & Usage Reports.


3.

Under the AWS Usage Report section, choose Create a Usage Report.


4.

On the Download usage report page, under Services, choose the service that you want to view 
usage for.

My Cost and Usage Report data doesn’t match the 
data in other Billing and Cost Management features



My Cost and Usage Report data doesn’t match 
the data in other Billing and Cost Management 
features

Other Billing and Cost Management features (Cost Explorer, Detailed Billing Reports, Billing and Cost 
Management console) might present your costs differently for the following reasons:

•

The billing features round cost data in different ways.


•

The billing features might have different data refresh settings. For example, you can choose whether 
or not your Cost and Usage Report automatically refreshes a previously closed bill with any refunds, 
credits, or Support fees applied after the bill is finalized. Cost Explorer automatically reflects the same 
items. In this scenario, if you don’t activate the automatic refresh on your Cost and Usage Report, then 
the Cost and Usage Report data won’t match the Cost Explorer data.


•

The billing features can group charges differently. For example, the Bills page in the Billing and Cost 
Management console shows data transfer charges as a separate Data Transfer grouping within yourAWS Service Charges. Meanwhile, Cost and Usage Reports and Cost Explorer show data transfer 
charges as a usage type for each service.




If after reviewing these reasons you still believe you're seeing discrepancies between your Cost and 
Usage Report and other Billing and Cost Management features, open a support case to request a 
review of your cost data. In your support case, make sure to provide the report name and the billing 
period that you would like reviewed. For more information on opening a case, see No alternate text specified

settings of my report

Open a support case to request a backfill of your cost data. In your support case, make sure to provide 
the report name and the billing period that you want backfilled. For more information on opening a case, 
see No alternate text specified
No alternate text specified
.

Note that you can't get a backfill of cost data for the following scenarios:

•

You can't get a backfill for cost data from before the date that you created the account.


•

If you use AWS Organizations and the structure of your organization changed, such as which account 
is designated the management account, then you can't get a backfill of data with the previous 
organization structure.


•

If you use AWS Organizations and you change organizations, then you can't get a backfill of data from 
prior to joining your current organization.




My report file folder in Amazon S3 is in an 
unnamed folder

Any / character in the Report path prefix of your report generates an unnamed folder in your Amazon 
S3 bucket. To remove the unnamed folder in your next report update, edit your report settings and 
remove the / character from the Report path prefix. For instructions, see No alternate text specified

I can’t select the option to include resource IDs on 
my report

When you create your report, you can select the option to Include resource ID. If you create your report 
with Report versioning set to Overwrite existing report, then you can’t modify your Include resource 
ID selection after you create your report. To include resource IDs, you must create a new report and 
select the Include resource ID option.

My Cost and Usage Report queries for Amazon 
Athena don’t work on Amazon Redshift, or my 
Amazon Redshift queries don’t work on Amazon 
Athena

Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift databases format Cost and Usage Report columns 
differently. Amazon Athena adds an underscore between words in the column name 
(line_item_normalized_usage_amount). Amazon Redshift adds an underscore between the column type 
and the attribute (lineitem_normalizedusageamount). Make sure to modify your queries to match the 
column name format in Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift.

The columns included in my report have changed 
from a previous month

The columns that AWS includes in your report depend on your AWS usage. Every report includes columns 
with the identity/, bill/, and lineItem/ prefixes:

•

identity/LineItemId


•

identity/TimeInterval


•

bill/InvoiceId


•

bill/BillingEntity


•

bill/BillType


•

bill/PayerAccountId


•

bill/BillingPeriodStartDate


•

All other columns are included only if your monthly AWS usage generates data to populate those 
columns. For example, your report includes savingsPlan/ columns only if you used Savings Plans during 
that month.

The queries or tables based on my report don’t 
work because the columns in my report have 
changed

The columns that AWS includes in your report depend on your AWS usage for the month. Because the 
columns included in your report can change, it’s a best practice to reference column names instead of 
column numbers in any custom queries or tables based on your report.

I can’t find the billing data for my Amazon EC2 
Dedicated Host

In the ResourceID column, look for the Dedicated Host ID rather than the instance ID. Because Dedicated 
Hosts are metered by Dedicated Host running hours, your report shows Dedicated Host usage by 
metered hours associated with the host ID.

I don’t understand the billing data for my Amazon 
EC2 Elastic IP addresses

Amazon EC2 Elastic IP addresses are metered in aggregate. This means that each line item in your report 
doesn’t correspond with an individual Elastic IP address. Each line item represents the total number 

100


AWS Cost and Usage Reports User Guide
I use consolidated billing and I don’t understand the 
difference between unblended and blended rates or costs



of chargeable hours. You can have one Elastic IP address assigned to a running instance at no charge. 
You’re charged per hour on a pro-rata basis for each additional Elastic IP address that you assign to the 
instance. Additionally, AWS charges an hourly fee for unassigned Elastic IP addresses.

I use consolidated billing and I don’t understand 
the difference between unblended and blended 
rates or costs

With consolidated billing for AWS Organizations, unblended and blended rates or costs can help you 
understand how much an account's usage would cost for a standalone account versus a linked account 
in an organization. Some services offer pricing tiers that can lower unit costs as usage increases. Because 
AWS aggregates all usage for a service in an organization, individual accounts might access lower-priced 
tiers sooner when their usage is aggregated in an organization's monthly usage.

Unblended rates are the rates associated with an individual account's service usage. For a line item, the 
unblended cost is usage multiplied by the unblended rate. The unblended cost would be the cost of the 
account's usage if it were a standalone account. Blended rates are the rates associated with total usage 
in an organization averaged across accounts. For a line item, the blended cost is usage multiplied by the 
blended rate. The blended cost is the cost attributed to the account's usage as a linked account in an 
organization.

For more information and examples of calculating unblended and blended costs, see No alternate text specified 
in the AWS Billing User Guide

Some line items in my report have a blended rate 
or blended cost of 0

Amazon EC2 line items with a Reserved Instance discount have an blended rate of zero. For these line 
items, the LineItemType is Discounted Usage.

The blended cost is the usage multiplied by the blended rate. If the value for blended rate or usage is 
zero, then the blended cost is also zero.

I don't understand how All Upfront Reserved 
Instances are amortized in my report

Because All Upfront Reserved Instances are paid in full upfront, the amortized costs are reflected in your 
report as the upfront payment divided over the associated time period (one year or three years).

reservation/AmortizedUpfrontCostForUsage and reservation/EffectiveCost are the same rate for All 
Upfront Reserved Instances. This is because both columns are an equal division of the upfront payment 
for the Reserved Instance over the total hours of its term.

It's expected that your report has RIFee line items populated for All Upfront Reserved Instances, even 
though the RIFee is $0.00. These line items represent the recurring hourly costs for the month, and they 
have additional usage data in other columns. All Reserved Instances generate RIFee line items.
